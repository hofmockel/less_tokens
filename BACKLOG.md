# Backlog

Planned work not yet started. Maintainer: add `CHANGELOG.md` entry + delete item here before merging. See [.claude/skills/bug-hunt/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/bug-hunt/SKILL.md) / [.claude/skills/bug-hunt/bughuntlog.md](.claude/skills/bug-hunt/bughuntlog.md) for the bug-hunt protocol.

Token-reduction strategy and rationale live in [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) → *Token-reduction strategy*. Shipped strategies use stable IDs (S8–S13).

## Token-Reduction Strategies

Primary mission: fewer tokens. Ordered by impact × enforceability. Each item names the bucket it attacks: **input** (context read in), **output** (prose/code Claude writes), **tool** (tool-result dumps), **fixed** (paid every turn regardless of task), **meta** (multiplies the others). The **fixed** bucket is the biggest blind spot — barely touched beyond the just-shipped claudemd skill.

### High Priority

### Low Priority

- **F3 — Terse hook block messages** *(output)* — block/reminder messages are output tokens, but paid only **on trigger**, not every turn; already trimmed once. Short learned codes (`S9: slice 51-3`) save bytes but need a legend (new fixed cost) and hurt readability. *Verdict: marginal — only worth it for a hook that fires constantly; otherwise skip.*
- **G7 — Subagent context re-derivation** *(input)* — parent writes a compact context pack (relevant slices + search hits) to `STATE_DIR`; spawned agents read that instead of re-reading/re-searching cold. Discipline + helper skill; hard to hook-enforce. *Verdict: defer — spiky, only pays when subagents run heavily.*

### Decided against (record to prevent re-proposal)

- **F4 — Consolidate overlapping tools** *(meta)* — `search.py`/`search_config.py`/`symbols.py`/`parse.py` have distinct jobs (search runtime / config / symbol index / AST parse). Merging is pure refactor: zero token saving, real regression risk across both agents. Not worth it.
- **S6 — Tiered effort** *(output)* — route tasks to Haiku/Sonnet/Opus via a tier matrix + flag. No hook can force a per-turn model downshift, so enforcement is weak and the claimed 50–70% saving is unverified. The shipped caveman Stop hook already captures output-token savings deterministically. Skip.

## Hooks & Caveman Mode

- **context-cache trusts mtime as proof of "unchanged"** *(tool / correctness)* — `check_read` ([agents/common/hooks/context_cache.py:88-97](agents/common/hooks/context_cache.py)) blocks a re-Read when `Path(file_path).stat().st_mtime` equals the recorded mtime, and the block message asserts "file unchanged. Skip this Read; content is still valid in context." mtime equality is **not** content equality: coarse filesystem mtime granularity, mtime-preserving writes (`cp -p`, `git checkout`/revert, `rsync --times`, editors that restore mtime), or clock skew can change the bytes while leaving mtime untouched. The hook then tells the agent stale content is current — and any `Edit` built on that cached view matches against the wrong text, silently. Likelihood is low and the upside (token saving) is real, but the failure mode lands on **edit correctness**, not just tokens, and is invisible when it happens. *Fix options, cheapest first: (a) add `st_size` to the cache entry + comparison (one extra field, catches most same-mtime content changes); (b) soften the message from "file unchanged" to "likely unchanged — re-read if you need exact bytes"; (c) key on a content hash for full correctness (most expensive, defeats some of the saving). Observed 2026-06-26 — fell back to `cat` to get exact strings for an Edit because the Read was cache-blocked.*

## Prose to Code

Rules, protocols, and configs expressed as natural language that could be deterministic scripts, structured data, or shorter pointers. Ordered by per-turn impact.

## Claude Agent

Claude-only token savings. Isolation walls: `agent_overrides.claude` in `.less_tokens/config/budget.json` (deep-merged per-agent at `agents/common/budget/config.py:82-84`, so Codex never sees it) and `.claude/settings.json` hook wiring (separate file from `.codex/hooks.json`). Touch only those and Codex is unaffected by construction.

## Developer Experience

### Low Priority

- **Consider GitHub self-hosted runners for the perf job** — the `perf` CI job downloads the fastembed model (~130 MB `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) and relies on `actions/cache`; a cold cache miss adds wall-clock time and network variance to timing results. A self-hosted runner with the model pre-installed in `~/.cache/huggingface` would remove both and give stable CPU baselines. Trade-off: infra maintenance + runner registration; only worth it if perf run times become a bottleneck or variance produces false failures. (Demoted: not on the token-reduction mission.)
